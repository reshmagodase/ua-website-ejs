            <h2>Wholesale Electricity Prices and Non-Commodity Costs are Rising</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Wholesale Electricity Price is rising. After almost two years of decline, we are now seeing regular
            price increases. This is a consistent trend, and one that we believe will continue (see <b>Fig.1</b> below).
            <img src="fig1.PNG" style="width: 100%;max-width: 1000px">
            Fig. 1
        </p>

        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h2>Macro & Microeconomic Changes are Forcing Prices Up</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Why is this happening? Well, a number of things have changed in recent months. Firstly at the
                Macro Economic level, the low oil prices of the last two years have forced many new sources of
                unconventional oil (for example, shale and tar sands) to shut down their operations. Next, OPEC (the
                cartel controlling the majority of output in the Middle East and Africa) has imposed a freeze on
                production at current levels, despite having in recent times let members produce as much as they
                wanted to. Finally, the IEA (International Energy Agency) has revised its forecast for global oil
                demand, driven by unexpectedly strong growth in gasoline demand in several key markets.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                These factors have resulted in oil nearly doubling in price to US$50/barrel, since the US$27/barrel
                low point in January.
            </p>

            <p>
                Secondly, at the Microeconomic level, several coal-fired power stations have closed (or are closing).
                This means, that dependent upon demand factors, there may be periods over this winter when the
                balance of demand with electricity generated, becomes very tight. <b> When this happens, prices
                increase – this can already be seen in this winter’s wholesale electricity price.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Sentiment in the market is bullish. Traders believe prices are more likely to rise than fall. Only last
                week, JP Morgan revised its forecast Oil price to almost US$60.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                The warning signs are there. All factors suggest, that the current low price being enjoyed by the
                market is temporary.
            </p>

            <h2>Actual Energy now only represents 40% of the cost of every Kwh</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Don’t be fooled into thinking that the price you are paying for every Kwh is the energy cost. It isn’t.
                In fact, only around 40% of the cost of every single Kwh you pay for, is actual energy.<b> The remaining
                60% consists of levies, taxes and other pass-through charges.</b> These are called Non-commodity
                Costs.
                So-called ‘Non-commodity’ costs, are mostly made up of a combination of the costs to transport the
                electricity to your meter (the costs of running the National Grid and your local distribution network)
                and the costs of subsidies and taxes to support renewables and climate change targets. All these
                charges are either regulated or set by the government, so they are non-negotiable. <b>We don’t
                believe they are going down any time soon. As you can see from the data in Fig.2 below, most are
                actually increasing.</b>

        <i>Illustrative costs for a customer consuming 10 GWh per year</i>
        <br>
        Fig 2.

        <p>
            These costs have increased substantially in the last few years, mostly driven by the drive to increase
            renewable generation and decarbonise our electricity system. <b>The increase in these costs has
            effectively offset the drop in wholesale prices seen in the first graph. The need to replace aging
            infrastructure, including the previously mentioned coal plants, will continue to drive these costs
            up – and the way some of them are charged is changing, too.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, the Capacity Mechanism (a new scheme which currently makes up a very small part of
            the bill) will be allocated to consumption during peak times (typically 4-7pm on weekdays), rather
            than spread evenly across all units. This gives rise to both risk and opportunity: risk if you consume a
            lot of energy at peak times, opportunity if you are able to shift your electricity consumption to other
            times of the day.

                <li> Venezuelan output is at risk due to political instability</li>
                <li>The market believes prices will increase rather than decrease</li>

                <li>The uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum is impacting both Foreign Exchange

            <h2>Our opinion</h2>
        </div>
        <div style="font-weight: bold">
            <p>We are exceedingly nervous about the market. The sheer level of geo-political uncertainty
                suggests only upwards movements, with regards energy prices. Several independent elements
                might singularly or collectively have a material and negative impact on the price of energy in the
                long term.</p>

            <p>Even should wholesale prices drop, we don’t believe delivered prices will be materially affected.
                Primarily, this is because the energy cost as a percentage of each unit of power, is outweighed by
                non-commodity costs.</p>

            <p>
                Therefore, our opinion is that if price certainty is a driving factor, then it would be beneficial to
                secure longer term contracts rather than short term.</p>

            <p>
                In other words, the safety of relatively low prices fixed over a long term contract, far outweighs
                the risk of chasing the bottom of the market and missing it.</p>
