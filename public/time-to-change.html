            This is the first of several discussions, looking at the behaviour of energy companies within the
            Business to
            Business
            sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is 2017, and technology has transformed many of our day-to-day practices. It has changed the way in
            which we lead
            our
            lives, disrupting our habits and routines, often (but not always) for the better. The purpose of these
            new
            technologies,
            has been to make the lives of consumers easier and therefore, less stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take for example, ordering your everyday groceries. You no longer need to go to the supermarket, as you
            can order
            them
            online and have them delivered direct to your door. But technology hasn't stopped there. If you now own
            an Amazon
            "Alexa" or the like, you don't even need to go online. All you do is instruct Alexa to buy the shopping
            for you, and
            job
            done! Who would've thought, that it would now be possible to have your shopping done, simply by talking
            to a robot?
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting aside the issue, as to whether or not these technological advancements are always beneficial,
            the principal
            remains, that they have been created with the customer in mind. Generally, with the view that customer
            satisfaction
            is
            what drives business, not the other way round. Whilst many companies sensibly adopt the "customer first"
            strategy,
            many
            do not. Indeed, in the energy sector we see this first-hand. Far too frequently, and often across the
            entire
            organisation, there is little or no focus placed on customer satisfaction - unless of course it is for
            sales, in
            which
            case the management have thrown more than enough resource to "sign you up" there and then, with little
            thought as to
            keeping you happy beyond the point of sale.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, I think I speak for most, when I describe how I feel my stress levels increase at the thought
            of contacting
            my
            organisation's utility provider for a non-sales issue, be it a provider for Water, Gas or Electricity.
            You will
            typically experience long wait times, a never-ending list of options to choose from, a terrible choice
            of "hold"
            music
            and hostile phone operators who give you little or no support - often whilst charging you for the
            privilege of being
            on
            the phone.

            Utility Aid took a closer look at this and found that only one of the "Big Six" answered business calls
            in under 30
            seconds, whilst others left customers hanging on the line for well over three minutes. This poor
            approach to
            customer
            service doesn't stop there. When you do eventually get to speak to someone, they often aren't able to
            address the
            issue
            satisfactorily, which means you need to make even more calls in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Investment in post-sale customer contact is almost non-existent. True, some suppliers have made token
            gestures
            introducing so-called "new technologies" or as they call them "client portals" whereby a customer
            logs-on to a basic
            account screen, in the hope of finding the information they are looking for. In practice, these are
            little more than
            basic web pages with limited client data - more importantly, they generally fail to address the need of
            the client -
            whom more often than not, requires answers from a human being. This is one of the major factors in
            organisations
            calling
            upon the services of Utility Aid. Utility Aid employs knowledgeable people who are able to immediately
            address the
            query
            of the customer, or go and find out the answer to the query. I will discuss more about Utility Aid
            resolving
            customers
            issues in the next blog.

        <p>
            However, for now, suppliers raising prices but not raising customer service is absurd! The supplier
            mentality of
            "sign
            them up now, but then provide as little support as we can get away with, afterwards", is not only
            backward and
            outdated,
            it is infuriating and patronising to consumers, who are both smart and deserving, and should be treated
            as such.
        </p>
        <p>
            The annals of corporate failure are littered with umpteen businesses that have ignored the demands of
            the consumer.
            It's
            time for energy providers to move out of the dark ages. We have the communication capabilities
            unimaginable even
            five
            years ago. So, I ask, why are these opportunities not being taken and exploited? Make life easier for
            your customers
            -
            that should be the driving force of an organisation - a customer centred approach at all times.
