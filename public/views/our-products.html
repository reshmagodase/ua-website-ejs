                <span style="color: #3697C2">How does Fixed Price Procurement Work? </span> <br>
                In a Fixed Price Strategy, your total requirement for energy is purchased in one single transaction. To
                strike the best possible price for you, timing is key. As such, we only fix the price after receiving
                notification from our team of analysts, who are tracking live market movements.
                <br> <br>
                <span style="color: #3697C2">What are the benefits of choosing Fixed Price Procurement?</span><br>
                Opting for a Fixed Price Strategy, guarantees prices for the duration of the contract. Thus, enabling
                budget certainty going forward. If your organisation requires price transparency, and cannot tolerate
                price movements up or down, then a Fixed Price Procurement Strategy may well be for you.

                <span style="color: #3697C2">Can I bundle my energy with a larger Basket, to obtain lower prices?</span><br>
                Utility Aid manages energy 'baskets' containing thousands of properties across the UK. By grouping the
                energy consumption together, the basket participants benefit from considerable purchasing power. In some
                instances, prices are often 10% less than direct renewal prices.
                <br> <br>
                <span style="color: #3697C2">How is the process managed?</span><br>
                We use a framework agreement to invite prospective suppliers to tender for the total volume of the
                basket. Using best practice methodology, we then filter the bids to drive the greatest value for our
                basket participants.

                <br>

                <span style="color: #3697C2"> How does market trigger strategy work?</span><br>


                Your energy consumption is split into blocks, typically of 6 or
                12 months duration. When signing the contract to supply,
                you choose the percentage to be purchased for the first block.
                This can be 50% or 75%. The procurement of the remaining
                block will then be determined by the movement in energy
                prices breaching agreed 'trigger' points.<br><br>
                If energy prices reach these triggers, a quote is generated
                for the second block.

                <span style="color: #3697C2">What are the benefits of choosing

                Using a trigger strategy allows you to take advantage
                of fluctuations in wholesale prices whilst providing the
                organisation with an element of budget certainty

                <br>

                <span style="color: #3697C2">How does Portfolio Managed Strategy work?</span><br>


                A Portfolio Managed Strategy allows organisations that
                typically don't have large energy consumption, the ability to
                access wholesale markets. By placing a number of clients
                collectively into the portfolio, their consumption is 'bundled
                together' in order to establish the necessary volume to access
                the wholesale markets.
                <br> <br>
                We manage the portfolio, making relevant purchase decisions
                throughout the duration of the contract, according to a
                pre-determined strategy. You still receive an individual
                contract and will be invoiced by the supplier. All of our
                portfolios are tendered with suppliers using a framework
                agreement. Suppliers invited to tender, are chosen after
                establishing the suitability of their product, service and
                price offering.

                <span style="color: #3697C2">What are the benefits of choosing
Portfolio Procurement?</span><br>

                Choosing Portfolio Procurement spreads the pricing risk,
                by making multiple purchases across the contract duration.
                This ensures that over the term, the portfolio achieves a
                reflective market price for each month. This then negates the
                stepped price variations many organisations face on renewal
                of fixed-term agreements.
