                    <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">What is LOA?</span>
                    <br>

                <p class="mainText"> When you use an Energy Broker, you need to sign a Letter of Authority - be
                    careful!</p>

                <p>

                    Worried about signing the dreaded Letter of Authority (otherwise known as an LOA)? Don't be, but do
                    make sure you double-check what you are signing.
                    <br><br>
                    Here at UA, we're incredibly sensitive to ethical practice. Not least, as we serve the
                    not-for-profit sector and appreciate the value every penny brings, to the amazing organisations
                    whose energy contracts we manage.
                    <br><br>
                    However, it never ceases to amaze us just how often some organisations are taken advantage of. Taken
                    advantage by unscrupulous energy brokers. Brokers whose LOA's are deliberately worded so as to
                    demand exclusivity, or that they be allowed to enter into contracts on the customerss behalf. This
                    is unethical and poor practice.
                    <br><br>
                    So, we thought it would be helpful to explain the purpose of an LOA, why it is needed, and what you
                    should and shouldn't sign.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you appoint an energy broker to act on your behalf, it is a legal requirement for the
                        broker
                        to obtain from you, a signed Letter of Authority, otherwise known as an LOA.
                    </li>


                    <li>In providing the LOA, you are enabling the energy broker to access information from your
                        existing
                        suppliers including: consumption data, contract end dates and contract prices.
                    </li>


                    <li>The energy broker will normally provide a template of the LOA for you to put onto your own
                        letterhead, sign and return. Please note, that both EON and British Gas (BG) require specific
                        LOA's
                        over and above the brokers LODependent upon who your energy suppliers are, you may need to
                        sign
                        all three LOA's.
                    </li>


                    <li>Without an LOA, an energy broker will not be able to obtain details of your current annual
                        consumption or other contract information, such as contract end date (CED), from your existing
                        supplier. This means they will not be able to provide you with accurate prices. If they tell you
                        otherwise, they are wrong. Perhaps more importantly, incorrect information can lead to delayed
                        start
                        dates or even failed contracts, which is costly to you the customer.
                    </li>


                    <li>The LOA is a legal requirement, as your information is protected under the Data Protection Act.
                        As
                        such, your supplier is not able to disclose this information without your express permission.
                    </li>


                    <li>If you sign an exclusive LOA then other brokers will not be able to compete for your business
                        throughout the validity period of the LOA. This means that you will end up paying higher prices
                        than
                        you need to. Guaranteed!
                    </li>


                    <li>If you sign an LOA that authorises the energy broker to enter into contracts on your behalf,
                        then
                        you are taking the decision making away from your organisation and giving it to a third party.
                        This
                        is akin to giving the keys to the chicken shed to the big bad fox. Nothing good will ever come
                        of
                        this!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please. Always read the LOA carefully! Our advice?
                    <br><br>
                    DO NOT SIGN an LOA that is "exclusive". Good energy brokers don't
                    need exclusivity as they aren't afraid of competition.
                    <br><br>
                    DO NOT SIGN an LOA that allows your energy broker to "enter
                    into contracts on your behalf". Ethical brokers don't take
                    decisions that impact your business. They only take decisions that
                    impact their own.

                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">Do you have OJEU Accreditation?</span>
                <br>
                Yes, UA have their own framework, OJEU reference 2015-078688 applies. For further information please
                contact <a href="mailto:aclayton@utility-aid.co.uk"
                           style="color: #17252A;">aclayton@utility-aid.co.uk</a>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">Does the LOA cover both Electricity and Gas?</span>
                <br>
                The LOA applies to the Broker/Supplier and not the meter. The Broker will use the same LOA even
                if you have Gas with one supplier and Electricity with another. Unless of course, you are contracted
                to EON and/or BG, in which case you might need to complete all three LOA's
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">Why do you need to know my contract end date?</span>
                <br>

                Suppliers need to know when your existing agreement ends, as the date a
                new contract starts has an impact on the price. For example, Gas prices for contracts starting one
                month ahead, are usually different from contracts starting six months ahead
                <br><br>

                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">Why do suppliers need to know the annual quantity of energy I use?</span>
                <br>
                Prices quoted generally depend on the volume consumed. For example, an organization with an
                annual consumption of 100,000 units will typically be paying more per unit, than one that consumes
                300,000 units per annum
                <br><br>

                <span style="color: #17252A"
                      class="fontBold">What do I do if my organisation doesn't have a letterhead?</span>
                <br>
                Copy the template onto plain paper and add your organisations details to the top where
                appropriate. If you have a company stamp, you should apply this also
                <br><br>

                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">Does the Energy Broker need exclusivity to obtain the best deal for us?</span>
                <br>
                The simple answer is no. If an Energy Broker demands exclusivity then you need to ask yourself
                why. Our advice? Change broker
                <br><br>

                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">Does the Energy Broker need to have the authority to enter contracts on our behalf?</span>
                <br>
                No and the energy broker should never be allowed to place contracts on your behalf. Ask yourself
                this. In any other circumstances, would you ever let someone else sign you into a contract without
                you knowing about it?
                <br><br>

                <span style="color: #17252A" class="fontBold">How long is the LOA valid for?</span>
                <br>
                Suppliers normally permit LOA's to be valid for one year from the date of signing. However, we
                have come across instances where Broker LOA's are valid for two plus years. The legality of these
                extended LOA's is unknown
