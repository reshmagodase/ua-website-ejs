Connect-s4a
=============

[SEO4Ajax](https://www.seo4ajax.com) is a service that allows AJAX websites (e.g. based on Angular, React, Backbone, Ember, jQuery etc.) to be indexable by search engines and social networks.

Connect-s4a is a middleware for Connect framework. It provides an easy way to
proxy GET requests from non-js clients (e.g. crawlers) to [SEO4Ajax](https://www.seo4ajax.com).

Usage
-----

The middleware must required before connect or express.

With connect :

    var connect_s4a = require('connect-s4a');
    var token = "your site token on SEO4Ajax";
    var connect = require('connect');
    var app = connect();
    app.use(connect_s4a(token));
    app.use(function(req, res){
        res.end('hello world\n');
    });
    app.listen(3000);

With express 3.x:

    var connect_s4a = require('connect-s4a');
    var token = "your site token on SEO4Ajax";
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express.createServer();
    app.use(connect_s4a(token));
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
        res.send('hello world');
    });
    app.listen(3000);

With express 4.x:

    var connect_s4a = require('connect-s4a');
    var token = "your site token on SEO4Ajax";
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();
    app.use(connect_s4a(token));
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
        res.send('hello world');
    });
    app.listen(3000);

With Meteor:

    import { WebApp } from 'meteor/webapp';
    import connect_s4a from 'connect-s4a';
    
    const token = "your site token on SEO4Ajax";
    
    Meteor.startup(() => {
        WebApp.connectHandlers.use(connect_s4a(token));    
    });

The connect_s4a function takes one mandatory parameter, the token of the site on SE04Ajax. The second parameter is optional, it is an object with these 2 properties:

- apiEndPoint: URL to the API of SEO4Ajax ("http://api.seo4ajax.com/" by default)

Installation
------------
Via npm :

    $ npm install connect-s4a

How it works
------------

This module checks the presence of the _escaped_fragment_ query parameter or the presence of a user-agent string identifying bots that do not support the Ajax Crawling Specification.
If the _escaped_fragment_ is present or a bot is detected, it requests the snapshot on SEO4Ajax and responds to the initial request with the concerned snapshot.


Requirements
------------

- node (>= 0.10.0)
- connect (>= 0.2.4) or express (>= 0.3.0)


Tests
-----

    node tests/run.js
